# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This product was made with a focus on logic implementation and not the design of the site itself.
The site has several extraneous features or strange implementations.
These were implemented as a challenge. For example, the ability to edit URLS.
The UI is also terrible, this is because HTML stylings were not toe point of this project/excersise
